## Google CoLab

If you don't have access to GPU or appropriate hardware, we have also created [Google CoLab project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12zFfL7rDAtXfzBwArh9hb0jvA38L_ODK?usp=sharing) 
for your convenience. 
Please follow the steps in the provided notebook to install the requirements and run the training and testing scripts.
All the libraries and pretrained models have already been set up there. 
The user can directly run DeepLIIF on their images using the instructions given in the Google CoLab project.
